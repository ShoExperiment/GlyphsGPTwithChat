# GlyphsGPT Corpus (Concise)

This corpus is tuned to reduce the two most common mistakes:
1) Wrong **undo** usage.
2) Forgetting the **shapes** API in Glyphs 3 (using `layer.paths` instead of `layer.shapes`).

Folders:
- `api.md` – comprehensive API list  must check.
- `rules.md` – short global rules the model should obey.
- `guides/` – brief explanations for undo and shapes.
- `recipes/` – tiny, correct snippets for common tasks **without** undo by default.

You can mix this corpus with your generated API docs in `corpus/api/`.
